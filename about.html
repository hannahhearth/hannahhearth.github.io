<p>I'm a senior design manager based in Denver, CO.</p>

<p>I've been a product designer and/or software engineer since
2014. I started off with a few different healthcare startups and non-profits, but
now you can find me in the dev tooling and infrastructure industry at HashiCorp.</p>

<p>Outside of work and blogging, I much prefer to be outdoors: hiking, biking,
skiing, woodworking. I also love being in the kitchen, making wild
ice cream flavors or homemade pastas. I live with my small but
growing family, largely centered around our handsome pit bull, Zeke.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-hearth-771a0a22/"
                                                           target="_blank">LinkedIn.</a></p>
