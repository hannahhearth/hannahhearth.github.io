My partner and I entered parenthood with a few key goals:

1. Raise a kid who feels loved.
2. Make parenting decisions based on data from real research.
3. Remain well-rounded human beings outside of parenthood.

Two years later, I can confidently say that, so far, we’ve done quite well on our goals. The first two warrant their own posts, but in this essay, I’m focused on the third.

First, what do I mean by “well-rounded human beings outside of parenthood”? That might mean something different to everyone. For us, there have always been top priorities that are key to joy and balance in our lives, including (not in any particular order):

- Hobbies
- Health
- Friendships
- Travel
- Careers

Raising kids is a demanding full-time job, a roller coaster ride of emotional and physical work. Many parents are so overwhelmed by the task of raising a kid that some or all of those priorities plummet to the bottom of their list below “just get through the day.” In some cases this happens as soon as the baby arrives, while in other cases, these things that made up a parent’s pre-kid life drift away over the course of years.

Prior to having a kid, my partner and I made plans to ensure we would stay committed to these endeavors as much as we could. Below, I’ve gone into more detail on our approaches to each one, and how we have made it work so far.

## Hobbies

We’re both deeply into our own personal hobbies. The act of creatively pursuing something fun outside of work and parenting is important to our own development, growth, and joyfulness.

A few weeks after having our baby, my husband went back to remote D&D games two nights a week. Meanwhile, I did a weekly Thursday night woodworking class with Austin Furniture School, and a weekly Wednesday night bike ride with friends. It helped that the remote nature of my husband’s activities actually kept him at home, but either way, we were committed to making it work for each other.

## Health

I knew my workouts might change shape as a parent, but I wanted to maintain a frequent, consistent routine to move my body in fun and healthy ways. About six months after birth, I signed up for a 100km women’s bike ride, and used that as my motivation to train.

Once we started started feeding our baby solid foods using the baby-led weaning method, we also aimed to feed him everything we ate. By the time he turned one, he was enjoying family meals with us at the table with no separate “kid’s meal”. In some ways, this led us to eat slightly healthier (less salt, less sugar, less fried) and unfortunately slightly less spicy (although some spice is fine!), than we would have otherwise.

## Friendships

We’ve heard of people who become parents, and then seem to disappear. They never leave their house, rarely commit to a babysitter, and turn friendships into one-way streets. We knew there would be new limitations on our schedules, but we wanted to continue to be “Yes” people, attend fun activities, and be there for our friends.

This is definitely one of the harder priorities to keep up. Friendships change over time naturally. We were in the middle of a pandemic with a new baby and not all our friends were parents; how could we expect our friendships to stay constant?

Nevertheless, we’ve done okay. When we get invited to a friend’s house for dinner, we bring the baby and his whole suite of sleep gear. When he needs to go to bed, we put him in his bassinet/pack-and-play in a quiet room in our friend’s house, turn on the sound machine, and enjoy our evening there. At around 11pm, we wake him up, bring him home, and put him back to bed in his own room. He does great with this. We know we got lucky with a super easy baby, but perhaps it also works because we started doing it when he was so young.

Other times, we’ve gotten a babysitter to go to a concert or try out a new cocktail bar with friends. We try to keep a few babysitters in our network so that we have plenty to reach out to on short notice.

## Travel

We decided to have a child after the pandemic had already began, so we accepted that traveling might be limited. But we didn’t want the baby to be what limited us. In fact, the opposite. We hoped to show our kid the world, and together, rediscover the joys of traveling (when safe again).

In his first year, our baby got to travel around the country quite a bit! Sonoma for some wine tours, NYC to visit friends and food, a wedding in NJ, hiking and skiing in Colorado, and Thanksgiving in Chicago. We did a mix of long-distance driving and flights. Both were really easy for us until our kid was about 6 months old. I can honestly tell you that at this point, we are done with road trips with a toddler! Never again!

## Careers

We figured that the lifestyle of a stay at home parent wasn’t the right fit for either of us, but we entered parenthood with an open mind for that to change. My husband had a ridiculous 6-month parental leave, and I had a generous 4-month leave.

We both wanted to return to a work environment that excited us. I was nervous about the stories I’ve heard of women feeling sad or guilty about going back to work. (The data on mothers leaving the workforce doesn’t tell the whole story though—many of these women aren’t staying home because of attachment, but because they don’t get equal support from their partners and can’t find or afford childcare.)

So, before I gave birth, I set myself up with loads of challenges; I asked my manager for more responsibility, started hiring to build a larger team, and aimed high for future promotions. By the time I went back to work, my anxieties had not come true; I was excited to be back at work with the challenges I had set up for myself. I was grateful to hand off my baby to a caregiver for a few hours a day, so that I could use other parts of my brain. No part of me felt guilty about it.

## The schedule that supports it

To fit it all in, we needed to plan ahead. We didn’t follow the same schedule every single week, but this is roughly what it looked like: trading off mornings to workout and having scheduled events for hobbies or get-togethers with friends in the evenings based around our baby’s bedtime of 7-7:30.

The pandemic kept my husband’s evening activities at home: remote games and video calls friends. This worked out super well because the baby would go down by 7:30 (again, thankful for a non-colic baby), then my husband could do his activities, and I was free to stay home or leave. Everyone wins.

## The systems and luck that support it

You might be a parent and find yourself wanting to punch me because of everything I’ve written here. Trust me, we *know* how lucky we are. We have a number of systems that support us in these goals:

- Long parental leaves for both parents
- Stable 9-5 work schedules at home offices
- Financial stability to afford quality full time care for our baby
- A healthy baby who sleeps well and eats well

## Reflections

Candidly, I wrote this post a year ago, when my kid was just turning one. It sat
in draft, collecting dust until I stumbled upon it today. Reading it now, I still feel great about how we approached parenthood and made space for ourselves in that first
year, and we have tried to continue those practices ever since.

Now, though, we're halfway into pregnancy number two. Our next baby arrives in a
few months, and we'll see how these habits shift or stay the same as we welcome
another member of our family to the fold.
